									<h2>Belgium <br> & <br> The Netherlands</h2>
                                </header>
                                <p>Here is another awesome trip that I did with my parents last summer (summer of 2019). Basically it was 5 days in Belgium, 3 days in The Netherlands 
                                and then we made a quick stop in Germany (Leipzig) when we were on our way to Poland (I was going to stay there for my Erasmus). But here I'll only 
                                talk about Belgium and the Netherlands. On this trip we stayed just one day in each city and I think it was 
                                enough to see everything that we wanted.</p>

                                <h1>Belgium</h1>
                                <p>The perfect place to stay in Belgium: Biendomo Bed & Breakfast, Reet. Reet is a small town 
                                located between Brussels and Antwerp. The hosts are so nice that you feel at home really. It is a little farm but the house is very modern and 
                                with a lot of space. The breakfast is made just before you are ready so it is very fresh and delicious. And if you have any doubts about what is 
                                the best way to go to Brussels or Antwerp or other city they will help you with that. </p>
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/belgium1.png" alt="" /></a>

                                <p>And two really nice restaurants near the Bed & Breakfast that you should try: Brasserie Mill and 'T Hofke Van Reet. There are some traditional 
                                dishes that you should try: mussels with belgium fries, stewed meat with belgium fries and ribs with (can you guest?) belgium fries. Yes, they 
                                eat a lot of belgium fries! </p>
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/belgium2.png" alt="" /></a>

                                <p>A little suggestion when we are sightseeing in Belgium, when you start to feel a bit tired in the afternoon stop in one of the many chocolate 
                                shops and eat a small chocolate to give you energy for the rest of the day. Chocolate in Belgium is obligatory!</p>

                                <p>So just a quick overview about what we did in Belgium. The 1st day we went to Antwerp, the 2nd to Brussels, then Bruges, then Ghent and on 
                                the last day we went to Lovaina in the morning, Lier in the afternoon and Mechelen in the evening. These last ones are smaller than the previous 
                                ones so it is possible to visit all three on the same day.</p>

                                <h2>Antwerp</h2>
                                <p>We went by car to Hemiksem, Callebeekstraat, and caught a boat to go to the center of Antwerp. It costs 5€ and 4€ for people under 24 years old. 
                                It is much cheaper and easy then to park in the city center. 
                                Antwerp is one of my favourite cities in Belgium. It is a city so beautiful that my advice is just walk around the city without a map and 
                                you'll find amasing monuments. At that time there was a Beer Festival that made the city even more fun and interesting. 
                                A nice and unique place to have lunch is Via Via, they serve a lot of different dishes and the decoration is something else.</p>

                                <h2>Brussels</h2>
                                <p>We went by car to Kontich - Lint train station and then we went to Brussels Central by train, comfortable and cheaper (7,4€). Brussels is 
                                the city chosen for comic strip lovers. All around the city there are comics and cartoons on the walls and also small statues. It is really 
                                funny to be walking down the street and find your favorite cartoon on the wall or just next to you. Besides that, it is a beautiful city that 
                                you should explore and try the famous belgium fries, they are delicious!</p>

                                <h2>Bruges</h2>
                                <p>We went by car to a Park & Ride (Baron Ruzettelaan 457, 8310 Brugge) to leave our car because the city center is car free so we had to 
                                park outside the city and also it is free. Then you can catch a bus to the city or walk like we did (about 3 kilometers). 
                                This city is full of tourists which can hide its personality. But after you go to the most famous places you go for a walk outside 
                                the main touristic spots, you will be amazed with the city's beauty.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:left">

                                <h2>Ghent</h2>
                                <p>Like we did in Brugge, we drove to a Park & Ride (P+R Watersportbaan) and we took a free shuttle to the city center.
                                Ghent, together with Antwerp, are my favourite Belgium citites. Ghent is a really beautiful city with nice people. Like Brugge, it had 
                                a lot of tourists, but as it is bigger it was not so crowed. It has a really nice atmosphere and the canals gave it a special touch.</p>

                                <h2>Lovaina</h2>
                                <p>We went by car to Lovaina city center because we were only planning to stay there for a couple of hours, so we paid the parking in 
                                the center. We walked around the city without a specific destination and discovered that this small city (compared to the previous ones) 
                                is very organized and beautiful. Like Coimbra in Portugal, it seems like a city of students which gives a little brightness to it. And 
                                like in all Belgium, lots of bicycles!</p>
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/belgium7.png" alt="" /></a>

                                <h2>Lier</h2>
                                <p>Then we went by car to Lier and found a big free park to leave the car and walk to the city. Like in Lovaina, we walked around 
                                without specific destination and I think it is the best way to explore this smaller cities. Because this way you can find amazing 
                                things without expecting and it is much more fun.</p>
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/belgium8.png" alt="" /></a>

                                <h2>Mechelen</h2>
                                <p>Next stop was Mechelen, we also went by car to the city center and left the car there (paid). We walked around but as they were 
                                setting up a festival the city was upside down so we couldn't enjoy it so much. But then we had dinner at an amazing brewery called 
                                Brouwerij Het Anker, the food is really good and if you like beer you must go there for sure.</p>
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/belgium9.png" alt="" /></a>

                                <h1>The Netherlands</h1>
                                <p>After these 5 days in Belgium we left and drove to The Neetherlands. Our accomodation was in Amsterdam (QBIC Amstermdam WTC), but 
                                in our way there we stop at Rotterdam and at the end of the day we went to Amsterdam. The next day we did some sightseeing in Amsterdam 
                                and the next day we went to Utrecht.</p>
                                <p>Here is the traditional food that you should try: Stroopwafel, Bitterballen, Appeltaart and the beer of course. Be careful with 
                                spacecakes and everything that has the bulldog symbol. For cheap and healthy food you have the Hema supermarket, usually they have a 
                                restaurant on the top floor.</p>
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/belgium10.png" alt="" /></a>

                                <h2>Rotterdam</h2>
                                <p>So we left Belgium and when we arrive to Rotterdam we parked at Parking Hofplein, the 
                                cheapest one we found in the city center. Then we did some sightseeing around the city and some shopping at TkMaxx. We had lunch at 
                                Markthal and I think it is the best idea because it has a lot of small restaurants where you can eat something quickly and continue your 
                                journey. It is a very modern city as it was almost everything destroyed with the war. </p>
                                <p style="text-align:left">

                                <h2>Amsterdam</h2>
                                <p>In Amsterdam we walked everywhere all day long (about 28 kilometers). Amsterdam is an amazing city, the canals make it unique and 
                                stunning. It has a lot of history as well as lots of tourists but it is so big that it is not very much crowded. And be very careful 
                                with the bicycles, they are everywhere and I mean literally everywhere believe me. And if you want a good coffee and a 'pastel de nata', 
                                you have to find the Casa Bocage - Portuguese Delicatessen. Also if you want to rest a bit in the evening you can go to Amstel Haeck 
                                and chill drinking a beer and then have dinner there. </p>

                                <h2>Utrecht</h2>
                                <p>On our last day in The Netherlands we decided to explore a smaller city, Utrecht. So we 
                                took a train to Utrecht Centraal (about 25 minutes). My advice is to walk randomly around the city, this city deserves a lot of 
                                exploring, you'll find amasing streets, corners and spots to rest a bit. And a obligatory stop is at Belgisch Biercafe Olivier Utrecht, 
                                to eat something or to drink a beer.</p>
