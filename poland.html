									<h2>Poland</h2>
                                </header>
                                <p>Poland was more a less my home for 6 months. I did a program exchange (Erasmus) there, 
                                so I had time to explore a big part of the country. I was staying in Wroclaw and I easily fell in love with it. For me is the best city of 
                                Poland but I have a little bit of bias of course. I stayed there from the end of August 2019 to the middle of February of 2020. So I experienced 
                                the extreme hot weather and the really cold weather. The places I explored were Wroclaw (my home), Szczeliniec Wielki, Krakow, Poznan, Gdansk, Warsaw, Zakopane and Auschwitz-Birkenau. The pictures 
                                below show a little of the beauty of Wroclaw.</p>

                                <h2>Wroclaw</h2>
                                <p>The city that made me feel at home. It is quite a big city (bigger than Porto), I honestly wasn't expecting that when I arrived. The Rynek 
                                (main square) is the most beautiful one I've seen during my trips. It is not very big but it is big enough to welcome the children, the teenagers 
                                and the adults to have a good time. And a cruise on the Odra River is a really good idea, the views are completly different than the ones you see 
                                in the city. One more thing that you can't miss is the opportunity to see how the lights on the streets were turned on. You should go to the old 
                                town at the end of the day and wait in front of Katedra św. Jana Chrzciciela. You can enjoy the beauty of the cathedral and wait for the man all 
                                dressed up whose job is to go around the town and light the street lamps.</p>

                                <h2>Szczeliniec Wielki</h2>
                                <p>A weekend in the nature. Basically this was a weekend trip of a summer school I did before my Erasmus. It is a little adventure walk 
                                through the mountains, it is good to relax and to do some team building. The mountains are not really big but the views are amazing and 
                                the track is the best part and a bit challenger because you have to go through some small holes between rocks. But I advice you to go with 
                                a guide otherwise you can get lost.</p>
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/poland4.png" alt="" /></a>

                                <h2>Krakow</h2>
                                <p>Krakow is a city a little bigger that Wroclaw and quite similar (but Wroclaw is more beautiful). It has a lot of history including a 
                                jewish neighbourhood that I advise you to check because there are a lot of marks from the past. But like every city in Poland, you can visit 
                                the main spots in a day.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:left">

                                <br> - Pod Wawelem Kompania Kuflowa
                                </p>

                                <h2>Poznan</h2>
                                <p>Poznan is a smaller city that doesn't have so much to see as the other ones. We spend a weekend here but we could do it easily in a day. 
                                Here we stayed in this very nice hostel called Blooms Boutique Hostel Inn & Apartments. It had a perfect location, an excellent kitchen and 
                                the staff was very helpful.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:left">
                                 - Wolności Square
                                <br> - Stary Rynek

                                <h2>Gdansk</h2>
                                <p>Gdansk is the second most beautiful city in Poland in my opinion. The fact that is on the coast is one of the reasons for it. Also it 
                                has a lot of history, I usually don't visit museums but we went to The Museum of Second World War and it was so worth it. You should also 
                                visit the Westerplatte, there is a building there from the war that is almost destroyed but you can go inside, it is so shocking.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:left">
                                 - Golden Gate
                                <br> - Gdansk Town Hall
                                <br> - Neptune's Fountain
                                <br> - The Museum of Second World War
                                <br> - Westerplatte
                                <br> - Gdansk Inscription Neon
                                </p>
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/poland7.png" alt="" /></a>

                                <h2>Warsaw</h2>
                                <p>Warsaw is the capital and the biggest city of Poland. It is possible to visit all in one day but 
                                it can be a bit tiring, so maybe it most be best to book a weekend for it. We satyed at Patchwork Warsaw Hostel, a very nice hostel and 
                                cool for students, the staff was incredibly sympathetic and helpful. The location of the hostel was really good, right next to the Palace of 
                                Culture and Science. By the way, if the queue to enter is not very big, I suggest you to go up the tower, there you can have a quite good 
                                view of the city.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:left">
                                 - Palace of Culture and Science
                                <br> - Złote Tarasy
                                <br> - Ogród Saski
                                <br> - Warsaw University Library
                                <br> - Stare Miasto

                                </p>
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/poland8.png" alt="" /></a>

                                <h2>Zakopane</h2>
                                <p>Zakopane, for me it was the most exciting experience of my Erasmus, I'd never seen so much snow. It seemed that I was inside a Christmas movie, 
                                I can´t describe it. We stayed in a very cozy apartment (Apartamenty u Gąsieniców Zakopane), it was very modern and had a lot of space. The hosts 
                                were really nice. We walked throw the city center and found a park were we had a snow fight and did a snow man (just like little children, it was 
                                the childhood we never had). We also did a walk through the mountains in direction of the Morskie Oko (a lake that at that time was frozen but 
                                the view was still breathtaking). There is a bus every 
                                20 minutes from the center to a point in the mountains and then it is a 9 kilometers walk to the lake and another 9 kilometers to 
                                get back (you have the choice to do these 9 kilometers in a horse-drawn sleigh). And take warm clothes because I've never been so cold 
                                in all my life! After this walk, why not rest a bit in the termal baths? We did that and I must say that it was awesome. And of course, 
                                you have to try skiing, it was the first time I did it and it loved it! There is one skii instance 300 meters from the apartment and 
                                it is very cheap.</p>
                                <p style="text-align:left">
                                 - Morskie Oko
                                <br> - Tatra Mountains
                                <br> - Chochołowskie Termy

                                <h2>Auschwitz - Birkenau</h2>
                                <p>An obligatory stop if you go to Poland. I'm not going to say much about it because you should experience it yourself. I only suggest you 
                                to do a little bit of research about that period in history, read some books about it (The Tattooist of Auschwitz, Cilka's Journey) or see 
                                some movies (Schindler's List, The Pianist).</p>
