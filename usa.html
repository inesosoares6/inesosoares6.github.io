									<h2>USA - Route 66</h2>
                                </header>
                                <p>Welcome to my favorite trip so far. It is big and exauting but it's completely worth it. ItÂ´s the kind of experience that everyone should 
                                go through, it changed my way to face my life and the world. I did it with my family (me, my brother and my parents), I should say that 4 people 
                                is the perfect number to do this kind of trip. It is perfect to fit in the car and you can share a room for 4 people that is much cheaper than 
                                if you go alone.</p>
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/usa1.png" alt="" /></a>
                                <p>After a long research, I realised that most sites suggested to do it in two or three weeks. But we wanted to enjoy the most of it so we did it 
                                in 25 days (from 1st August to 25th August of 2017). And if you are thinking that it is too expensive because it is almost 5000 kilometers and 24 
                                nights, I should say that the prices are nothing like in Europe. The gas is much cheaper, you can fill the car's tank with 20 euros and we paid in 
                                average 100 euros per night for the four of us (staying in city centers). Let's be honest, in Europe this would be impossible.</p>

                                <p>The Route 66 is an historic road of the USA, known as "The Mother Road" and it goes from Chicago to Los Angeles. Along the way we did a little 
                                detour to visit the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas (these places don't belong to the Route 66 but they were a really good upgrade to the trip). So in 
                                total we visited the following cities: Chicago IL, Pontiac IL, Springfield IL, St. Louis MO, Springfield MO, Tulsa OK, Oklahoma City OK, Amarillo 
                                TX, Midpoint TX, Tucumcari NM, Santa Rosa NM, Santa Fe NM, Albuquerque NM, Gallup NM, Flagstaff AZ, Grand Canyon AZ, Kingman AZ, Las Vegas NV, 
                                Needles CA and Los Angeles CA.</p>
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/usa3.png" alt="" /></a>
                                <p>There are a good variety of restaurant chains along the road, but a think that if you find these ones, you should really try them: Applebee's and 
                                Shake Shack.</p>

                                <h2>Chicago</h2>
                                <p>First stop: my favorite city! We stayed 4 days in Chicago and I think it was enough to see 
                                the most important monuments and to know a completely different city than we are used to. There everything is huge, this is the perfect word 
                                to describe this city. It made us fell in love with it instantely. It could also be because we see a lot of TV series about Chicago, 
                                nevertheless we were amazed. </p>
                                <p>Little advice: if you are not really interested in paying to see stuff, I should advise you to go up a skyscraper. My favorite one was 
                                Skydeck Chicago, because you have like a small window where the floor is made of glass and you can see 
                                the whole city and it is spectacular!</p>
                                <p style="text-align:left">

                                <p>Quick stop in Pontiac to get the kick off of Route 66. This is an important stop to enter the spirit of the Mother Road. </p>

                                <p>After 330 kilometers we arrived at Springfield, Illinois. A city much smaller and quieter than Chicago but full of history. 
                                Balen's is a really nice sports bar with very friendly people were I tryed the most spicy burger ever. </p>

                                with a lot more pleople and traffic.</p>

                                were renewing the city. This city has two distinct parts: the Old Town and the new one.</p>

                                (just like the ones we seen in movies) in the middle of town.</p>

                                the landscape is so different. And here, in Arizona, it is just breathtaking. It is so beautiful that you want to take pictures of everything but 
                                the camera can't capture the beauty that you see with your eyes. A really nice restaurant: Beaver Street Brewery.</p>

                                <h2>Grand Canyon</h2>
                                <p>Next stop: favorite experience! A little detour from the Route 66, 125 kilometers from Flagstaff comes what I call the only place that left me 
                                amazed every day I was there. I couldn't get enough of that view. And it is like I said before, we want to take pictures to remember it later but 
                                the camera can't capture so much beauty. I think I can describe it as monumental, grandiose, majestic and so much more that I have no words for it. 
                                You should see for yourself.</p>
                                <p>We stayed here 3 days and if we had the time I would have stayed for a week or so. But as we chose to stay in the Lodges of the Grand Canyon 
                                National Park it would be like a small fortune to stay there a week. Although I think it is the best way to get the experience, one day we wake up 
                                and we had a deer at our door. It was priceless!</p>
                                <p>Big advice: this accommodation has to be one of the first to book. There aren't many lodges in the park compared with the people that want to go 
                                there, so they get full really fast.</p>

                                <h2>Kingman</h2>
                                <p>Back to the Mother Road, 280 kilometers later, we arrived at Kingman. It was a quite nice surprise in the middle of nowhere! We were welcomed 
                                with a BBQ at the hotel.</p>

                                <h2>Las Vegas</h2>
                                <p>Just 165 kilometers away from Kingman is the Sin City: Las Vegas. The city where you can travel across the world just in one street, the Stip. 
                                If you have no idea of what to expect in Las Vegas, be prepared because this city will surprise you every moment of every day. We like to say that 
                                Las Vegas is fake but unique! Just a little tip: have you ever imagine a storm inside a shopping mall which is inside a hotel? Well, it happened! 
                                And I won't spoil it anymore, you should see for yourself. We stayed here 3 days and I think it was enough to get the idea of the spirit.</p>

                                <h2>Needles</h2>
                                <p>180 kilometers away from the Sin City is Neddles, already in California. I should admit that 
                                this city is the one that you just stop to rest and move to the next one. It doesn't have nothing interesting to see, the only thing that I can 
                                point out is the Pirate Cove Resort. It is kind of interesting to visit because you can see a different way to be at beaches. Instead of having a 
                                towel to lay down, they have a boat.</p>

                                <h2>Los Angeles</h2>
                                <p>Final stop: Los Angeles! 415 kilometers from Needles. A really big city and, for us, a bit disappointing. We were shocked by the number of homeless 
                                people that we found. I understand that it is the city of dreams, that everyone goes to be famous and sometimes that goes bad, but I wasn't expecting 
                                that. Besides this, this is a city worth visiting, because you have it all. You have beaches, you have downtown, you have parks, you have Beverly Hills 
                                and, of course, you have Hollywood.</p>
                                <p>We stayed in Los Angeles for five days. When we arrived we were really tired so we didn't have so much energy as at the beginning and the traffic 
                                also didn't help (be prepared to spend a few hours in traffic). So our sightseeing was a bit slower. Thus I kept the impression that we didn't see all, 
                                 I think we saw the most important for us.</p>
