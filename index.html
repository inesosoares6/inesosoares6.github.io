									<h2>Inês de Oliveira Soares</h2>

									<b>Hi&ensp;</b> <img src="images/hand.gif" style="height:32px"><br/>
									I am Inês, I am 24 years old and I am an Electrical and Computer Engineer. Robots fascinate me since I was a child. In fact, I started entering robot competitions when I was only 10. 
									So, for a long time, I knew that I would be studying Electrical and Computer Engineering; my master thesis consisted 
									in developing a human-robot interface to program by demonstration an industrial robot using Extended Reality. In addition to robotics, I have a 
									particular interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, subjects that I studied during my semester abroad in Poland.<br/> <br/>
									Besides studying, I love to do sports, more specifically, I practiced Karate for 10 years and I have been playing Volleyball for almost 15.
									At a certain time, I was doing both sports, but it was impossible to manage the two sports at the same time because the schedules overlapped. 
									So, I decided for the one that challenged me the most, Volleyball, and now I dare to say that it was the right choice. I was team captain 
									for 6 years and in 2 of them we were able to win the National Championship.<br/> <br/>
									Ever since I can remember, I have loved traveling and one of my hobbies is to plan trips. During my semester abroad I organized weekend trips 
									for my group of friends almost every week. This enabled me to explore Poland and all countries around it; each weekend a new city, sometimes 
									more than one per weekend. Until now, the biggest trip that I organized was in 2017, Route 66 in the USA, the mother road that connects Chicago 
									to Los Angeles, it lasted 25 days and I must say that it was life changing. <br/> <br/>
									A fun fact about me is that I have more pleasure doing tasks when I feel challenged, so why should I say no to new adventures? 
									Moreover, if this new challenge expands my comfort zone, it is certain that I am going to accept it. 
									Beyond that, I do my very best in every single task, to meet the goal and to be proud of the final result. 
									This is how my mindset works, instead of thinking ``Why?" I always think ``Why not?".</p>
