									<h2>Inês de Oliveira Soares</h2>

									Hi, I am Inês and I am 23 years old. Robots fascinate me since I was a child. In fact, I started entering robot competitions when I was only 10. 
									So, for a long time, I knew that I would be studying Electrical and Computer Engineering.
									Besides studying, I love to do sports, more specifically, I practiced Karate for 10 years and I have been playing Volleyball for almost 15.
									At a certain time I was doing both sports but it was impossible to manage the two sports at the same time because the schedules overlapped. 
									So, I decided for the one that challenged me the most, Volleyball, and now I dare to say that it was the right choice. I was team captain 
									for 6 years and in 2 of them we were able to win the National Championship. Furthermore, when I was growing up it was much more than just 
									a sport. In 2013, in order to raise money for the team, we organized a science fair in the pavilion and club associates and athletes from
									 7 to 70 were thrilled to learn what we had to share. <br/>
									Since I can remember, I love to travel and one of my hobbies is to plan trips. 
									Until now, the biggest trip that I organized was in 2017, the Route 66 in USA, the mother road that connects Chicago to Los Angeles, 
									it lasted 25 days and I must say that it was life changing.
									<br/>A fun fact about me is that I have more pleasure doing tasks when I feel challenged, so why should I say no to new adventures? 
									Moreover, if this new challenge expands my comfort zone, it is certain that I am going to accept it. 
									Beyond that, I do my very best in every single task, in order to meet the goal and to be proud of the final result. 
									This is how my mindset works, instead of thinking ``Why?" I always think ``Why not?".</p>
