                  Poland was more or less my home for six months. I did a
                  program exchange (Erasmus) there, so I had time to explore a
                  big part of the country. I was staying in Wroclaw and I easily
                  fell in love with it. For me is the best city of Poland, but I
                  have a little bit of bias of course. I stayed there from the
                  end of August 2019 to the middle of February of 2020. So I
                  experienced the extreme hot weather and the really cold
                  weather. The places I explored were Wroclaw (my home),
                  Szczeliniec Wielki, Krakow, Poznan, Gdansk, Warsaw, Zakopane
                  and Auschwitz-Birkenau. The pictures below show a little of
                  the beauty of Wroclaw.

              The city that made me feel at home. It is quite a big city (bigger
              than Porto), I honestly wasn't expecting that when I arrived. The
              Rynek (main square) is the most beautiful one I've seen during my
              trips. It is not very big but it is big enough to welcome the
              children, the teenagers and the adults to have a good time. And a
              cruise on the Odra River is a really good idea, the views are
              completely different than the ones you see in the city. One more
              thing that you can't miss is the opportunity to see how the lights
              on the streets were turned on. You should go to the old town at
              the end of the day and wait in front of Katedra św. Jana
              Chrzciciela. You can enjoy the beauty of the cathedral and wait
              for the man all dressed up whose job is to go around the town and
              light the street lamps.

                A weekend in the nature. Basically this was a weekend trip of a
                summer school I did before my Erasmus. It is a little adventure
                walk through the mountains, it is good to relax and to do some
                team building. The mountains are not really big but the views
                are amazing and the track is the best part and a bit challenging
                because you have to go through some small holes between rocks.
                But I advice you to go with a guide otherwise you can get lost.

                  Kraków is a city a little bigger that Wroclaw and quite
                  similar (but Wroclaw is more beautiful). It has a lot of
                  history including a jewish neighborhood that I advise you to
                  check because there are a lot of marks from the past. But like
                  every city in Poland, you can visit the main spots in a day.

              Poznań is a smaller city that doesn't have so much to see as the
              other ones. We spend a weekend here but we could do it easily in a
              day. Here we stayed in this very nice hostel called Blooms
              Boutique Hostel Inn & Apartments. It had a perfect location, an
              excellent kitchen and the staff was very helpful.

            <p>
              Gdańsk is the second most beautiful city in Poland in my opinion.
              The fact that is on the coast is one of the reasons for it. Also
              it has a lot of history, I usually don't visit museums but we went
              to The Museum of Second World War and it was so worth it. You
              should also visit the Westerplatte, there is a building there from
              the war that is almost destroyed but you can go inside, it is so
              shocking.

            <p>
              Warsaw is the capital and the biggest city of Poland. It is
              possible to visit all in one day but it can be a bit tiring, so
              maybe it most be best to book a weekend for it. We stayed at
              Patchwork Warsaw Hostel, a very nice hostel and cool for students,
              the staff was incredibly sympathetic and helpful. The location of
              the hostel was really good, right next to the Palace of Culture
              and Science. By the way, if the queue to enter is not very big, I
              suggest you to go up the tower, there you can have a quite good
              view of the city.

            <p>
              Zakopane, for me was the most exciting experience of my Erasmus,
              I'd never seen so much snow. It seemed that I was inside a
              Christmas movie, I can't describe it. We stayed in a very cozy
              apartment (Apartamenty u Gąsieniców Zakopane), it was very modern
              and had a lot of space. The hosts were really nice. We walked
              around the city center and found a park were we had a snow fight
              and did a snow man (just like little children, it was the
              childhood we never had). We also did a trail through the mountains
              in direction of the Morskie Oko (a lake that at that time was
              frozen but the view was still breathtaking). There is a bus every
              20 minutes from the center to a point in the mountains, and then
              it is a 9 kilometers walk to the lake and another 9 kilometers to
              get back (you have the choice to do these 9 kilometers in a
              horse-drawn sleigh). And take warm clothes because I've never been
              so cold in all my life! After this walk, why not rest a bit in the
              thermal baths? We did that, and I must say that it was awesome.
              And of course, you have to try skiing, it was the first time I did
              it, and I loved it! There is one ski track 300 meters from the
              apartment, and it is very cheap.

                An obligatory stop if you go to Poland. I'm not going to say
                much about it because you should experience it yourself. I only
                suggest you to do a little bit of research about that period in
                history, read some books about it (The Tattooist of Auschwitz,
                Cilka's Journey) or see some movies (Schindler's List, The
                Pianist).
