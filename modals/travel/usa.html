                  Welcome to my favorite trip so far. It is big and exhausting
                  but it's completely worth it. It's the kind of experience that
                  everyone should go through, it changed my way to face my life
                  and the world. I did it with my family (me, my brother and my
                  parents), I should say that 4 people is the perfect number to
                  do this kind of trip. It is perfect to fit in the car and you
                  can share a room for 4 people that is much cheaper than if you
                  go alone.

                After a long research, I realized that most websites suggested
                to do it in two or three weeks. But we wanted to enjoy the most
                of it so we did it in 25 days (from 1st August to 25th August of
                2017). And if you are thinking that it is too expensive because
                it is almost 5000 kilometers and 24 nights, I should say that
                the prices are nothing like in Europe. The gas is much cheaper,
                you can fill the car's tank with 20 euros and we paid in average
                100 euros per night for the four of us (staying in city
                centers). Let's be honest, in Europe this would be impossible.

                The Route 66 is an historic road of the USA, known as "The
                Mother Road" and it goes from Chicago to Los Angeles. Along the
                way we did a little detour to visit the Grand Canyon and Las
                Vegas (these places don't belong to the Route 66 but they were a
                really good upgrade to the trip). So in total we visited the
                following cities: Chicago IL, Pontiac IL, Springfield IL, St.
                Louis MO, Springfield MO, Tulsa OK, Oklahoma City OK, Amarillo
                TX, Midpoint TX, Tucumcari NM, Santa Rosa NM, Santa Fe NM,
                Albuquerque NM, Gallup NM, Flagstaff AZ, Grand Canyon AZ,
                Kingman AZ, Las Vegas NV, Needles CA and Los Angeles CA.

              <p>
                There are a good variety of restaurant chains along the road,
                but I think that if you find these ones, you should really try
                them: Applebee's and Shake Shack.

                    First stop: my favorite city! We stayed 4 days in Chicago
                    and I think it was enough to see the most important
                    monuments and to know a completely different city than we
                    are used to. There everything is huge, this is the perfect
                    word to describe this city. It made us fell in love with it
                    instantly. It could also be because we see a lot of TV
                    series about Chicago, nevertheless we were amazed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Little advice: if you are not really interested in paying to
                    see stuff, I should advise you to go up a skyscraper. My
                    favorite one was Skydeck Chicago, because you have like a
                    small window where the floor is made of glass and you can
                    see the whole city and it is spectacular!

              is a really nice sports bar with very friendly people were I tried
              the most spicy burger ever.

                    Almost 400 kilometers later, we arrived at the state of
                    Arizona, city of Flagstaff. I should say that each state
                    seems from a different country, the landscape is so
                    different. And here, in Arizona, it is just breathtaking. It
                    is so beautiful that you want to take pictures of everything
                    but the camera can't capture the beauty that you see with
                    your eyes. A really nice restaurant: Beaver Street Brewery.

                Next stop: favorite experience! A little detour from the Route
                66, 125 kilometers from Flagstaff comes what I call the only
                place that left me amazed every day I was there. I couldn't get
                enough of that view. And it is like I said before, we want to
                take pictures to remember it later but the camera can't capture
                so much beauty. I think I can describe it as monumental,
                grandiose, majestic and so much more that I have no words for
                it. You should see for yourself.

                We stayed here 3 days and if we had the time I would have stayed
                for a week or so. But as we chose to stay in the Lodges of the
                Grand Canyon National Park it would be like a small fortune to
                stay there a week. Although I think it is the best way to get
                the experience, one day we wake up and we had a deer at our
                door. It was priceless!
              </p>
              <p>
                Big advice: this accommodation has to be one of the first to
                book. There aren't many lodges in the park compared with the
                people that want to go there, so they get full really fast.

                  in Las Vegas, be prepared because this city will surprise you
                  every moment of every day. We like to say that Las Vegas is

                  storm inside a shopping mall which is inside a hotel? Well, it
                  happened! And I won't spoil it anymore, you should see for
                  yourself. We stayed here 3 days and I think it was enough to

                180 kilometers away from the Sin City is Needles, already in
                California. I should admit that this city is the one that you
                just stop to rest and move to the next one. It doesn't have
                nothing interesting to see, the only thing that I can point out
                is the Pirate Cove Resort. It is kind of interesting to visit
                because you can see a different way to be at beaches. Instead of
                having a towel to lay down, they have a boat.

                    Final stop: Los Angeles! 415 kilometers from Needles. A
                    really big city and, for us, a bit disappointing. We were
                    shocked by the number of homeless people that we found. I
                    understand that it is the city of dreams, that everyone goes
                    to be famous and sometimes that goes bad, but I wasn't
                    expecting that. Besides this, this is a city worth visiting,
                    because you have it all. You have beaches, you have
                    downtown, you have parks, you have Beverly Hills and, of
                    course, you have Hollywood.

                    We stayed in Los Angeles for five days. When we arrived we
                    were really tired so we didn't have so much energy as at the
                    beginning and the traffic also didn't help (be prepared to
                    spend a few hours in traffic). So our sightseeing was a bit
                    slower. Thus I kept the impression that we didn't see all, I
                    think we saw the most important for us.
