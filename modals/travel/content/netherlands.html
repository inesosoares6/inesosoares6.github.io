    Our accommodation was in Amsterdam (QBIC Amsterdam WTC), but in our way
    there, we stop at Rotterdam, and at the end of the day, we went to
    Amsterdam. The next day we did some sightseeing in Amsterdam and next we
    went to Utrecht.

    Here is the traditional food that you should try: Stroopwafel, Bitterballen,
    Appeltaart and the beer of course. Be careful with spacecakes and everything
    that has the bulldog symbol. For cheap and healthy food you have the Hema
    supermarket, most of them have a restaurant on the top floor.

<p>
  When we arrive to Rotterdam we parked at Parking Hofplein, the cheapest one we
  found in the city center. Then we did some sightseeing around the city and
  some shopping at TkMaxx. We had lunch at Markthal and I think it is the best
  idea because it has a lot of small restaurants where you can eat something
  quickly and continue your journey. It is a very modern city as it was almost
  everything destroyed with the war.

<p>
  In Amsterdam we walked everywhere all day long (about 28 kilometers).
  Amsterdam is an amazing city, the canals make it unique and stunning. It has a
  lot of history as well as lots of tourists but it is so big that it is not
  very much crowded. And be very careful with the bicycles, they are everywhere
  and I mean literally everywhere believe me. And if you want a good coffee and
  a 'pastel de nata', you have to find the Casa Bocage - Portuguese
  Delicatessen. Also if you want to rest a bit in the evening you can go to
  Amstel Haeck and chill drinking a beer and then have dinner there.

<h2 class="py-3 border-bottom" id="utrecht">Utrecht</h2>
<p>
  On our last day in The Netherlands we decided to explore a smaller city,
  Utrecht. So we took a train to Utrecht Centraal (about 25 minutes). My advice
  is to walk randomly around the city, this city deserves a lot of exploring,
  you'll find amazing streets, corners and spots to rest a bit. And a obligatory
  stop is at Belgisch Biercafe Olivier Utrecht, to eat something or to drink a
  beer.
