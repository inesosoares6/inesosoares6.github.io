                The perfect place to stay in Belgium: Biendomo Bed & Breakfast,
                Reet. Reet is a small town located between Brussels and Antwerp.
                The hosts are so nice that you feel at home really. It is a
                little farm but the house is very modern and with a lot of
                space. The breakfast is made just before you are ready so it is
                very fresh and delicious. And if you have any doubts about what
                is the best way to go to Brussels or Antwerp or other city they
                will help you with that.
              </p>

                class="img-fluid mb-3"
              />

              <p>
                And two really nice restaurants near the Bed & Breakfast that
                you should try: Brasserie Mill and 'T Hofke Van Reet. There are
                some traditional dishes that you should try: mussels with
                belgium fries, stewed meat with belgium fries and ribs with (can
                you guest?) belgium fries. Yes, they eat a lot of belgium fries!
              </p>

              <p>
                A little suggestion when we are sightseeing in Belgium, when you
                start to feel a bit tired in the afternoon stop in one of the
                many chocolate shops and eat a small chocolate to give you
                energy for the rest of the day. Chocolate in Belgium is
                obligatory!
              </p>

              <p>
                So just a quick overview about what we did in Belgium. The 1st
                day we went to Antwerp, the 2nd to Brussels, then Bruges, then
                Ghent and on the last day we went to Lovaina in the morning,
                Lier in the afternoon and Mechelen in the evening. These last
                ones are smaller than the previous ones so it is possible to
                visit all three on the same day.
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2 class="py-3 border-bottom" id="antwerp">Antwerp</h2>
            <p>
              We went by car to Hemiksem, Callebeekstraat, and caught a boat to
              go to the center of Antwerp. It costs 5€ and 4€ for people under
              24 years old. It is much cheaper and easy then to park in the city
              center. Antwerp is one of my favorite cities in Belgium. It is a
              city so beautiful that my advice is just walk around the city
              without a map and you'll find amazing monuments. At that time
              there was a Beer Festival that made the city even more fun and
              interesting. A nice and unique place to have lunch is Via Via,
              they serve a lot of different dishes and the decoration is
              something else.

            <h2 class="py-3 border-bottom" id="brussels">Brussels</h2>
            <p>
              We went by car to Kontich - Lint train station and then we went to
              Brussels Central by train, comfortable and cheaper (7,4€).
              Brussels is the city chosen for comic strip lovers. All around the
              city there are comics and cartoons on the walls and also small
              statues. It is really funny to be walking down the street and find
              your favorite cartoon on the wall or just next to you. Besides
              that, it is a beautiful city that you should explore and try the
              famous belgium fries, they are delicious!

            <h2 class="py-3 border-bottom" id="bruges">Bruges</h2>
            <p>
              We went by car to a Park & Ride (Baron Ruzettelaan 457, 8310
              Brugge) to leave our car because the city center is car free so we
              had to park outside the city and also it is free. Then you can
              catch a bus to the city or walk like we did (about 3 kilometers).
              This city is full of tourists which can hide its personality. But
              after you go to the most famous places, you should go for a walk
              outside the main touristic spots, you will be amazed with the
              city's beauty.

            <h2 class="py-3 border-bottom" id="ghent">Ghent</h2>
            <p>
              Like we did in Brugge, we drove to a Park & Ride (P+R
              Watersportbaan) and we took a free shuttle to the city center.
              Ghent, together with Antwerp, are my favorite Belgium cities.
              Ghent is a really beautiful city with nice people. Like Brugge, it
              had a lot of tourists, but as it is bigger it was not so crowed.
              It has a really nice atmosphere and the canals gave it a special
              touch.

                  <p>
                    We went by car to Lovaina city center because we were only
                    planning to stay there for a couple of hours, so we paid the
                    parking in the center. We walked around the city without a
                    specific destination and discovered that this small city
                    (compared to the previous ones) is very organized and
                    beautiful. Like Coimbra in Portugal, it seems like a city of
                    students which gives a little brightness to it. And like in
                    all Belgium, lots of bicycles!

                  <p>
                    Then we went by car to Lier and found a big free park to
                    leave the car and walk to the city. Like in Lovaina, we
                    walked around without specific destination and I think it is
                    the best way to explore this smaller cities. Because this
                    way you can find amazing things without expecting and it is
                    much more fun.

                  <p>
                    Next stop was Mechelen, we also went by car to the city
                    center and left the car there (paid). We walked around but
                    as they were setting up a festival the city was upside down
                    so we couldn't enjoy it so much. But then we had dinner at
                    an amazing brewery called Brouwerij Het Anker, the food is
                    really good and if you like beer you must go there for sure.
