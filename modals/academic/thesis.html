              &emsp;The world is living the fourth industrial revolution,
              Industry 4.0; marked by the increasing intelligence and automation
              of manufacturing systems. Nevertheless, there are types of tasks
              that are too complex or too expensive to be fully automated, it
              would be more efficient if the machine were able to work with the
              human, not only by sharing the same workspace but also as useful
              collaborators. A possible solution to that problem is on
              human-robot interactions systems, understanding the applications
              where they can be helpful to implement and what are the challenges
              they face.
              <br />
              &emsp;In this context a better interaction between the machines
              and the operators can lead to multiples benefits, like less,
              better, and easier training, a safer environment for the operator
              and the capacity to solve problems quicker. The focus of this
              dissertation is relevant as it is necessary to learn and implement
              the technologies which most contribute to find solutions for a
              simpler and more efficient work in industry. This dissertation
              proposes the development of an industrial prototype of a human
              machine interaction system through Extended Reality (XR), in which
              the objective is to enable an industrial operator without any
              programming experience to program a collaborative robot using the
              Microsoft HoloLens 2.<br />
              &emsp;The system itself is divided into two different parts: the
              tracking system, which records the operator's hand movement, and
              the translator of the programming by demonstration system, which
              builds the program to be sent to the robot to execute the task.
              The tracking system is executed by the Microsoft HoloLens 2, using
              the Unity platform and Visual Studio to program it. The robots'
              translators for programming by demonstration system's core was
              developed in Robot Operating System (ROS). The robots included in
              this interface are Universal Robots UR5 (collaborative robot) and
              ABB IRB 2600 (industrial robot). Moreover, the interface was built
              to easily add other robots.
