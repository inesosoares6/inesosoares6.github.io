            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
              Progr(Ch)ess is a program to promote success that, combining
              programming, robotics, and chess, explores countless benefits of
              the oldest board game, through attractive and innovative dynamics.
              Using a strong playful component, this project aims to contribute
              to the development of capacities associated with computational
              thinking and digital literacy, fostering transversal skills in the
              curriculum. The transferability of chess, programming, and
              robotics allows not only to reinforce the domain of computing but
              also other domains of learning (e.g., reading, writing,
              mathematics, expressions, etc.). Thus, it is important to make
              learning more and more meaningful and contextualized, challenging
              students to develop multidisciplinary competencies, and
              reinforcing confidence in their capabilities. The target audience
              for this project is elementary school students.

            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To develop a Virtual Reality application to integrate this
                project; for cost management, the application should be
                compatible with Google Cardboard.
              </li>
              <li>
                The application should be divided into 4 parts:
                <ul>
                  <li>Pieces Identification Game;</li>
                  <li>Pieces Movements Game;</li>
                  <li>Board & Pieces Setup Game;</li>
                  <li>King Attacks Game.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Each game should have several levels for the students to first
                learn the rules and then increase their skills along the game.
              </li>
            </ul>
