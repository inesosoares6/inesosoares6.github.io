                <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>
                  This app was created to solve an existing problem in my home.
                  So, before this app, we had a paper in our house where we
                  would write the things to buy at the supermarket. But the
                  problem was that most of the time we would forget the paper at
                  home, or we wanted to add something and we were not home. To
                  solve all those problems, my parents asked me to create an app
                  that would be our shopping list and it was shared by all of us
                  in real time.
                </p>
